# Lualhaunting
 ## Overview
This is my first game, made because my college professors required me to. It was initally a horror game, but because the AI I was planning was far too complicated and I had little time, I was forced to make it into a roguelike game.

## Mechanics
Players must kill "Lualhati", a haunted statue with a thirst for revenge and rack up as much points as possible. 
Pick up health potions to keep going.

## Controls
Standard WASD and F for attack.

## Assets
Credits to: Szadi art (https://szadiart.itch.io/) for the character asset.
